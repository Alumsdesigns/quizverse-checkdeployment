- Font Stacks: Each font stack includes a system font fallback (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, or serif) to ensure fast loading and readability even if the Google Font fails to load.

- Main Font (Lato): Used for the body text, making it a highly readable and modern sans-serif font for general content.

- Heading Font (Playfair Display): Used for headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) and paragraphs (p), giving the site a distinct and elegant serif style.

- Buttons & Choices Font (Roboto): Applied to buttons and quiz choices, providing a clean, clear, and easy-to-read sans-serif style for interactive elements.
